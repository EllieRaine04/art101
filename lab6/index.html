					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked with Working with our partner to experiment with 
						JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Problems that we faced was trying to understand why things werent 
						working properlly and realizing it was a simple punctuation issue
						 where something wasn't written out correctly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought that this assignmnet was really interesting to work on
						 and I'm starting to notice on my own now how to ensure things work 
						 properlly and to make sure that the punctuation is correct.</p>
