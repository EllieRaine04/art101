					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Elisa Anderson and I an a second year double majoring in AGPM and FILM. I really
						 enjoy art in painting, writing, drawing, and animation and anything ctreative. I am hopeful
						 that I will learn a lot in this course that will be useful later on in my pursual twoards 
						 working in animation in the future. I strive to one day work for disney working to create 
						 movies that can connect with people in many ways and help them to discover themselves as 
						 they did for me. I really enjoy reading and watching Disney movies religiously as well as
						 watching and listening to musicals. My favorite games currently is Little Nightmares two 
						 and Dreamlight Valley. I am a bit of a horror movie fanatic thanks to my mother and love 
						 watching scary creepy movies as well as heartfelt Disney Movies. </p>
