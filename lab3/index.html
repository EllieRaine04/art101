			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to work with a partner and create a local 
						file structure on our computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server 
						while also taking screenshots to prove we'd done it.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My mail problem that I ran into was the coding for the bulletin points for our
						websites. I was okay in putting in alll of the information, but for some reason
						there was something not quiet write and the code was reading that there was another
						bulletin point without any information in it so there was an extra blank on on my page 
						that I was not able to get rid of. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I thought that this was a really interesting assinment to work on and I think 
						that I'm finally starting to get the hang of reading code and such and I am excited
						to see and work on what we decide to go over next!</p>
