             <h1>Hello World</h1>

             <p>My name is Elisa Anderson and I an a second year double majoring in AGPM and FILM. I really
                 enjoy art in painting, writing, drawing, and animation. I am hopeful that I will learn a 
                 lot in this course that will be useful later on in my pursual twoards working in animation 
                 in the future. I really enjoy reading and watching Disney movies religiously. My favorite 
                 games currently is Little Nightmares two and Dreamlight Valley. My partner Bao was a friend 
                 of mine in a previous class and we thought that it would be fun to team up again and work on 
                 programming projects together. Even though they called my the wrong name the first couple of 
                 times that we talked we go along really well and were able to laugh it off and work together 
                 on a lot of really cool projects. They also major in AGPM and we've had prior experience 
                 designing games together and seeing eachothers work.
